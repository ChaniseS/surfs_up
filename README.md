# Surfs_up Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
After providing data to W.Avy regarding Oahu, we were then tasked with providing more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results of Analysis:
* First, we created and printed out the Summary Stats for the Month of June:

* Next, we created and printed out the Summary Stats for the Month of December:

* Based on the analysis, it is obvious to say that June will be the best month, weather wise, for the Ice Cream Shop as compared to December. Since there are no major differences between June and December, we can assume that the weather is consistent all year-around for Oahu.

## Summary of Analysis:
Overall, I believe the Surf & Ice Cream shop will do exceptionally well in Oahu. The Temperature alone is the perfect weather for Ice Cream - itâ€™s just a great combo, I think.

We could also run the data based on the Precipitation difference for the months of the year. That would make a big difference on whether or not customers come for Ice Cream or not.
